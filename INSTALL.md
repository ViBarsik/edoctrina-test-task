LogicalQuiz Web Aplication
============================
### Required software

- Nginx 1.10+
- PHP 7.0+
- PHP-FPM 7.0+
- MySql 5.7
- [NodeJs LTE 6+ + NodeJs NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)

INSTALLATION
------------

### 1.Clone project and install packages
Clone a project from the repository

In Nginx site config file correct param:
~~~
...
root  /path/to/project/web;
...
~~~

Open the folder into which the project was cloned and run custom cmd (if you OS is Windows)
Input next command:

~~~
composer install
~~~

After end composer process open next directory:
~~~
/path/to/project/nodeJsServer
~~~
and run npm process:
~~~
npm install
~~~
### 2.Create database
When the installation of packages is completed, it is necessary to prepare the Mysql database for the project. 
You must connect to your server in superuser privileges
~~~
mysql --user={root_user} --password={root_password} --host={localhost or ip}
~~~

After a successful connection, you need to create a database:
~~~
CREATE DATABASE `logicalquiz` CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
~~~

and database user with grant privileges by this database:
~~~
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON logicalquiz.* TO logicalquiz@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'xxxzzzaaawww' WITH GRANT OPTION;
~~~

`logicalquiz@localhost` can be replaced by `logicalquiz@'%'` if the database located on remote server

After executing the previous command, you should check the connection to the created database. 
To do this, run the following command in the console:

logout root
~~~
quit;  
~~~
sign in as created user:
~~~
mysql --user=logicalquiz --password=xxxzzzaaawww --host=localhost
~~~
If login is success, input:
~~~
quit; 
~~~
Else, carefully read the message that sent the server Lusk in the console and eliminate the errors.

If you did not correct the user and database creation commands and the process completed successfully, the following configurations can be 
left unattended during the installation via the web interface:

    'mysql_host' => 'localhost',
    'mysql_user' => 'logicalquiz',
    'mysql_password' => 'xxxzzzaaawww',
    'mysql_database' => 'logicalquiz',

### 3.Web configuration
Follow in your browser to the site of the installed project.
Go in your browser to the site of the installed project and edit, at least, the `[socket_url]` configuration.
If you are satisfied with the other settings, click button `"Install LogicalQuiz"`. 

### 4.Start NodeJS Socket Server
Go to `/path/to/project/nodeJsServer` and in this path run next command:
~~~
node index.js
~~~


This completes the installation. If everything was done correctly in the previous steps and the necessary requirements are met, 
then the application will start working successfully. If you get errors after installation or something does not work out,
